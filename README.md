# Perfecting-Your-Drawing
Many drawing tools, such as iPad, have a function that when you are drawing a shape by hand, they will guess what it is, and make the best fit one to replace it. For example, if you draw a lopsided circle, it will produce a perfect one for it. In this assignment, i do that using the magic from linear algebra.
